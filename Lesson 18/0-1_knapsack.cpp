/* You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the 
 * knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item, In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1]
 * which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
 * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights
 * of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
 * Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines. 
 * The first line consists of N the number of items.
 * The second line consists of W, the maximum capacity of the knapsack.
 * In the next  line are N space separated positive integers denoting the values of the N items and 
 * in the fourth line are N space separated positive integers denoting the weights of the corresponding items.
 * Output:
 * Print the maximum possible value you can get with the given conditions that you can obtain for each test case in a new line.
